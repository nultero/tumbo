# only flag Tumbo needs is -h or --help?
config opts:
    DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH  ->  where Tumbo and its aliases live
    DEFAULT_SHELL_SOURCE  ->  where to put zipped aliases when source func is called
    TRUNCATE_SOURCE ->  only for not appending to _aliases or rc files
                        > flag for non-truncate for rc files?
